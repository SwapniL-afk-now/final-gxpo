"""Assert-based code-execution reward for HumanEval+/MBPP+-style benchmarks.

Unlike the stdin/stdout APPS-style format handled by `prime_code`, HumanEval+ and
MBPP+ ship a self-contained `test` script per problem: it either defines
`check(candidate)` (HumanEval+ convention — caller invokes `check(entry_point_fn)`)
or directly references the entry-point function name at module level (MBPP+
convention). Both are handled here by executing `candidate_code + test_script` in
an isolated subprocess and, if a `check` function was defined, calling it explicitly.
